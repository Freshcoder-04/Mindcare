Project Overview:
Create a full-stack web application called MindCare designed to support student mental health. The app will empower students by offering confidential self-assessment tools, a curated mental health resource library, anonymous chat rooms for peer support, and a streamlined system for booking counseling appointments. It will also include a dedicated counselor portal for managing appointments, curating resources, and communicating directly with students.
Note that in this project we donâ€™t want people to register their details like name, phone number or email. They should be able to log in using an anonymous username (an 8 digit number) and password. 
Key Features and Functionalities:
Self-Assessment Module:
Interactive Questionnaires: Develop submittable forms with questions which can be modified (add/delete/edit) by mental health professionals.
AI-Personalized Feedback: Analyze responses in real time and deliver personalized insights and recommendations using AI to help students track and manage their mental health. 
Have a threshold score to alert the counselor. Make the students do the test and give a score to them and give feedback using AI. If the score > threshold, alert the counsellor about the student, the counsellor will have a section in their application view and they can check on whoever was flagged. 
Resource Library:
Content Curation: Build a searchable repository of articles, videos, and tips focused on stress management and mental well-being.
Advanced Search and Filters: Implement robust search functionality so users can quickly find resources by keywords, topics, or content type.
User Engagement: Allow students to star or save their favorite resources for future reference.
Counsellor should be able to post articles and not no one else. Like a counsellor will be able to curate articles, like a twitter post counsellor should be able to make and link articles, videos in that.
Anonymous Chat Rooms:
Confidential Peer Support: Provide secure, real-time chat rooms where students can engage in anonymous discussions and share personal experiences without revealing their identities. (random username as generated by the app)
Real-Time Communication: Use technologies to ensure instant updates and a seamless conversation experience.
Counseling Appointment System:
Booking Interface: Develop an intuitive scheduling system that allows students to easily book appointments with available counselors.
Counselors can add their available time slots on the calendar and that calendar will be visible to every user and they can book slots by simply clicking on the slot they want to book.
The booked slot should then be marked closed.
User Roles and Use Cases:
Students:
Complete interactive self-assessment questionnaires to monitor stress, anxiety, and depression and get AI analysed scores for their test.
Browse a dynamic resource library containing trusted articles, videos, and tips on mental well-being, created by the counselors.
Participate in secure, anonymous chat rooms to share experiences and offer peer support.
Book counseling appointments and engage in direct messaging with counselors when needed.
Counselors/Mental Health Professionals:
Access a dedicated portal to view, manage, and update their appointment schedules.
Curate and publish mental health resources (articles, videos, external links) that appear in the resource library.
Communicate one-on-one with students via chat and review self-assessment submissions to provide personalized feedback.
Add/delete/edit questionnaires.
Technical Specifications:
Frontend:
Build the user interface using React to ensure a modern, responsive, and intuitive experience across all devices.
Backend:
Use Node.js with Express to create RESTful API endpoints for handling user authentication, data processing, and business logic.
Real-Time Functionality:
Implement Socket.io to facilitate live updates in the anonymous chat rooms and for real-time messaging between students and counselors.
Database and Security:
Store user data in a PostgreSQL database with encryption protocols to safeguard sensitive information both in transit and at rest.
Design Patterns:
Singleton Pattern: Ensure a single, uniform instance for managing configurations and state in real-time features like chat rooms.
Observer Pattern: Set up an event-driven architecture to automatically update users with notifications (e.g., for new messages or appointment changes).
Facade Pattern: Create a simplified interface for counselors to manage and publish content in the resource library.
Command Pattern: Encapsulate user actions (such as booking, canceling, or rescheduling appointments) into discrete command objects for better code management and future scalability.
Implementation Considerations:
Authentication and Authorization:
Secure the application using middleware to ensure that students and counselors access only the sections of the app relevant to their roles.
API Design:
Follow RESTful design principles to create clear, maintainable, and scalable backend endpoints.
User Experience:
Focus on creating an accessible and confidential interface, especially for sensitive features like self-assessments and anonymous chat rooms.
Security Best Practices:
Incorporate industry-standard security measures, including regular updates to encryption protocols and adherence to data protection regulations.
Deployment and Testing:
Prioritize modular development to build a working prototype within one month, starting with core functionalities and incrementally integrating real-time and AI features
Also have a random username attached to a student. The app should not ask students about their info like name, age, etc. It should automatically assign a random username to the student. There won't be any registration process as such, just that this username will be mapped to a student uniquely to ensure anonymity.
